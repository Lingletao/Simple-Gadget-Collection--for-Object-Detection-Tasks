# Simple-toolbox-for-Object-detection-tasks
Automatic labeling, conversion of different data set formats, sample size statistics, model cascade 
This is a simple collection of tools for converting annotation file formats for computer vision object detection. The usage method is very simple, you only need to copy the py script file to the folder you need to convert, modify the script, and specify the parameters you need. Please refer to the tutorial for detailed usage. 

# 1. Automatic image annotationï¼š
`auto_annotate_mmdetect.py`  
This tool is to help you complete a large number of labeling tasks quickly. It is based on the target detection model trained by [mmdetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection).   
First, you need to use mmdetection and a small amount of **labeled data** (about 200~300 images) to train to get a rough object detection model(e.g. Faster-RCNN: [faster_rcnn_r50_fpn_1x_coco.py](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/tree/master/configs/faster_rcnn)). If you don't know how to use mmdetection to train a object detection model, I strongly suggest you read the [tutorial](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/blob/master/docs/2_new_data_model.md) on mmdetection first.  
Second, use `auto_annotate_mmdetect.py` to mark the remaining large amount of unmarked data and generate a VOC format (xml) file.Before that, you need to modify some places to specify the name of the annotation object and the place where the annotation file is saved.   
`
files_path = '../project/mmdetection/data/image'              # The path of the image folder to be annotated  

img_save_path = './results'                                   # The path of the annotated images to be saved  

xml_save_path = './Annotations'                               # The path of the image annotation files (xml) to be saved  

cfg = './faster_rcnn_r50_fpn_1x_coco.py'                      # Your model configure file (mmdetection)  

wgt = './epoch_12.pth'                                        # Your model weight file  

device = 'cuda:0'                                             # Use GPU  

class_dic = {'0': 'cat',

             '1': 'dog',  
             
             '2': 'rabbit',  
             
             '3': 'mouse'}                                    # Class ID --> Class name  

`
Finally, you can use [labelImg](https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg) to **manually** correct the automatically generated files.   



# 2.Conversion of different data set annotation formats:
2.1 voc2coco.py
Usuage:
Step1: copy voc2coco.py to VOC dataset folder that you are going to transfer (as shown below).
'
  Before:
  dataset_VOC
  |--ImageSets
  |  |--Main
  |     |--train.txt
  |     |--val.txt
  |     |--trainval.txt
  |--Annotations  <--xml files are put there
  |--JPEGImages   <--images are put there
  |--voc2coco.py <--you should put it here 
'
Step2: excute voc2coco.py.
'
After:
dataset_COCO
  |--train  <--images for training are copied there
  |--val    <--images for valuation are copied there
  |--train.json
  |--val.json
'

2.2 coco2yolov5.py
Usuage:
 Step1: copy coco2yolov5.py to the coco dataset folder that you are going to transfer (as shown below).
 Step2: specify the dataset name, and run this script.
    Before:
    --dataset_coco
    |--train.json <--annotation json file (for training)
    |--val.json   <--annotation json file (for valuation)
    |--train      <--images are saved here (for training)
    |--val        <--images are saved here (for valuation)
    |--coco2yolov5.py <--you should put it here

    After:
    --dataset_yolo
    |--train--images <--images are saved here (for training)
    |       |-labels <--annotation txt file (for training)
    |
    |--val----images <--images are saved here (for valuation)
           |-labels <--annotation txt file (for valuation)
